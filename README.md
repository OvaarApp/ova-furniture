# 🪑 Ova Furniture – Flutter UI Prototype

Ova Furniture is a Flutter-based mobile prototype built by **Ovaar**.  
It was developed in just a few days from a static Dribbble mockup to demonstrate our ability to transform beautiful designs into real, smooth, and functional applications.

## 🧠 Why this prototype?

At **Ovaar**, we specialize in designing full-stack digital systems.  
While our core focus is smart and scalable backend development, we equally value user experience.

This project was created to:

- Showcase frontend proficiency using **Flutter**
- Prototype a real-world e-commerce furniture app from a **static design**
- Test UI responsiveness and animations in a production-like environment
